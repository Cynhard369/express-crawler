## About the project

### Project aim
Evidence supports that the admission requirements for chinese highschool graduates to enter universities in Australia are lower than ones of most remarkable univerities known as '985' or '211' in China. Therefore, undergraduates of these remarkable univerities in China enjoy better academic quality. Australia Education Management Group (AEMG) is an organisation that sends undergraduates abroad to continue study for bachelor degree. To convince Australian university admissions office of the quality of undergraduates provided by AEMG, data evidence needs to be collected, processed and presented, which is the aim of the project.<br/><br/>
